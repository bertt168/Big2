# Design Report
> Please follow the instructions in homework 1 (officially announced version on NTU COOL) to finish the report.


## Software Design

> The purpose of the design report is to help the TAs grade the software design (and bonus) part by
human. We hope that you can illustrate every class of your design with:
> - its name
> - a **one-sentence** description of its duty
> - a **short** description of how it possibly interacts with other classes

> Don't elaborate too much on every class 
> since we will directly inspect your code for details.


## Bonus Design: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
> You will either get 0 or 20 points on this bonus.
> If you can't achieve it, don't report anything here.
